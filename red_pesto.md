Red pesto
=========

Quick, easy and delicious red pesto.

Suitable for vegetarians who eat cheese.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 small jar of sun-dried tomatoes in oil
* 2-3 dl of parmesan or VÃ¤sterbotten cheese
* 2-6 cloves of garlic (more tastes better, fewer makes you taste better)
* roasted pine nuts or sunflower seeds
* salt and pepper

Instructions
------------

1. Grate the cheese and chop up the garlic.
2. Put all the ingredients in a small blender and add oil, salt and pepper according to taste (use the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes; skip the salt if using salted pine nuts/sunflower seeds).
3. Blend.
4. Serve with pasta.

Protip: Cover any leftover pesto in oil, and it'll last longer in the fridge.
